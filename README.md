# HypixelTweaks
 Small plugin with a few tweaks

Features:
 - Autowho (Currently just for Bedwars)
 - Json Remover (An old mod I made to remove the /locraw commands other developers had forgotten)
 - Config file to toggle features on and off

Coming in v1.1.0 (soon):
 - Auto dodge for bedwars/skywars
 - Skywars autowho
 - Update checker
 - In-game config editor

If you have any issues with features not working try turning on compatibility mode in the config.
